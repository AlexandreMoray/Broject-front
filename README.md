# Broject Web App Front End
The frontend server of the Broject platform. 

# What is it made of ?
It is based on the Angular framework.
It connects to the backend server via several Http routes to retrieve the information it needs to work. 
The angular template of a platform meant to manage all your personal and professional projects.

# How to use Broject
This platform helps you managing all your personal and professional projects. The idea is to create projects and add notes to them to organize your work. 
A user can register on the platform to start creating projects, and add notes to them. During the creation of a project, you can add other users to it, so they can also work with you. 

Each note has a degree of importance that you set, to help you priorize issues in your projet. 
Projects also have a progression level, from 0 to 100, that you can raise or lower according to how you feel the project is going.
